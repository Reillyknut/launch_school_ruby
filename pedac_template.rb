*** (Understand the) Problem: ***
Understand what the problem is and what it's asking. Take some time to allow the problem
to load into your brain. Don't rush this.

First, identify the inputs and the outputs of the problem

input:




output:




_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Check for Problem Domain: area of expertise or application that needs to be examined to solve a problem.
Basically any domain-specific terms or concepts that may be applicable. It limits scope of the problem.

Example: if problem asks you to add up a set of multiples, make sure you know what multiples are.
Could one word have multiple meanings? etc

Problem Domain:





_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Check for Implicit Requirements.  Are there requirements that are not explicitly stated?

Implicit Requirements: 




_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Clarifying Questions: Questions to ask interviewer (or yourself) to better understand the problem.

Mental Model: summary of the "entire problem" written in your own words.
Is *what* the problem requires--not *how*.  How is implemented in the Algorithm section.

Can keep the number of mental models to one if it fully, and accurately, captures problem requirements

Your Mental Model:





===================================================================================================
*** Examples / Test Cases / Edge Cases: ***

Examples: 
THE OBJECTIVE IS to come up with examples that validate your understanding of the problem, and confirm
that you are working in the right direction.  Typically the confirmation will come from documentation of 
a process, or a person.

Your Examples:




_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Test Cases:
Note: Rules for a specific problem are oftentimes an excellent place to find test cases.  If you're 
working with collections, it's a good idea to find test cases that deal with zero, one or multiple
elements in the collection.

Try to provide test cases that handle any edge cases you can find.
If you're working with collections, it's a good idea to find test cases that deal with zero, one or
multiple elements in the collection.

Your Test Cases:





_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Edge Cases:
Example: problems that involve iterating over numbers have edge cases that are at both ends of the 
range. Typically can involve working with negative numbers, 0, or extremely high values.

Your Edge Cases:





===================================================================================================
*** Data Structure:***
Determine what data structures you will work with to convert the input to the desired output.

THE CHIEF CONSIDERATIONS HERE are your intended programming language and your mental model.
Are you going to use arrays, hashes, etc? Your data structure will influence your program.





===================================================================================================
*** Algorithm: ***
Start with mental model if you have one, otherwise can start with Data Structure, and think about how
you'd build and manipulate it to get to the output. Example: if you're going to use an array maybe
you would want to focus on constructing or iterating over a collection.

** THE CHIEF OBJECTIVE HERE is to determine series of instructions to turn input into the desired output.

    - The challenege is to get to the right amount of detail (think about the steps to creating a
    peanut butter and jelly sandwich.)
    - You want something that you can readily convert to code without actually writing code.
    - Before implementing the algorithm, you should test it manually with test cases.
